# Huffman_ZIP
HuffEncode is a web-based tool for compressing text files using Huffman coding, a powerful lossless data compression algorithm. Upload a .txt file, and HuffEncode generates a compressed version with detailed Huffman codes for each character. With a sleek interface and efficient backend, itâ€™s perfect for students, developers, or anyone exploring data compression techniques.

## Features  
- **File Compression**: Encode `.txt` files using Huffman coding for efficient storage.  
- **Dynamic Huffman Codes**: View the unique Huffman codes assigned to each character.  
- **Easy File Download**: Download the compressed file directly from the app.  
- **Modern UI**: Enjoy a clean and responsive design with animations.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Algorithm**: Huffman coding for lossless data compression
